The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with
the GUAC services. It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph
as well as a means to explore the supply chain, and prototype policies.

Since the GUAC Visaulizer is still in an early experimental stage, it is likely
that there may be some unexpected behavior or usage problems. For a more robust
use of GUAC, we recommend using the
[GraphQL interface directly](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/blob/main/demo/GraphQL.md).

To get started with GUAC visualizer, look at our guide [here](docs/setup.md).

Once started, looking through packages might look something like this:
