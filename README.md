# GUAC Visualizer

The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with
the GUAC services. It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph
as well as a means to explore the supply chain, and prototype policies.

Since the GUAC Visualizer is **still in an early experimental stage**, it is likely
that there may be some unexpected behavior or usage problems. For a more robust
use of GUAC, we recommend using the
[GraphQL interface directly](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/blob/main/demo/GraphQL.md).

## Get Started

To get started with GUAC visualizer, look at the guide on [our official docsite](https://docs.guac.sh/guac-visualizer/).

Once started, using the visualizer might look something like this:
