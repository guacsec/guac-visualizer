# Getting started with GUAC Visualizer

## About

The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with
the GUAC services. It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph
as well as a means to explore the supply chain, and prototype policies.

Since the GUAC Visaulizer is still in an early experimental stage, it is likely
that there may be some unexpected behavior or usage problems. For a more robust
use of GUAC, we recommend using the [GraphQL interface directly](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/blob/main/demo/GraphQL.md).

## Requirements

### Tools:

- yarn
- docker

### Services

The GUAC visualizer requires the running of the GUAC services. For more
information on how to do this, click
[here](https://docs.guac.sh/getting-started/).

## Getting started

If you already haven't, clone the GUAC visualizer repo. We highly suggest
cloning it in the same path as you clone the main
[GUAC repo](https://github.com/guacsec/guac).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:guacsec/guac-visualizer.git
```

Change directories into the repo.

```bash
cd guac-visualizer
```

All commands run throughout this guide should be in this working directory.

## Running the visualizer from source

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

The output should look like:

````
$ yarn install
yarn install v1.22.19

## Configuration

By default, the GUAC Visualizer assumes that the GraphQL server is running on http://localhost:8080/query. However, you can optionally configure the visualizer to connect to a different GraphQL endpoint or to read from a `guac.yaml` config file from your curent working directory.

### Optional:

If you need to, you can use environmental variables to configure the GraphQL endpoint for the visualizer, specifying the endpoint: `GUAC_GQL_ADDR` and config file: `GUAC_CONFIG_PATH`. To set these environment variables, create a new file in the root of the project called `.env.local`. Inside this file, add the following lines:

```bash
GUAC_GQL_ADDR='http://graphql-server-endpoint'
GUAC_CONFIG_PATH='/path/to/guac.yaml'
```

Replace `http://your-graphql-server-endpoint` with your actual GraphQL server endpoint if it is different from the one specified in your `guac.yaml` file, and `/path/to/guac.yaml` with the actual path to your guac.yaml file.

The `next.config.js` file uses these environment variables to configure the visualizer. If `GUAC_CONFIG_PATH` is set and the `guac.yaml` file specifies a `gql-addr`, it will be used. If `GUAC_GQL_ADDR` is set, it will override the `gql-addr` from the `guac.yaml` file.

**Note:** any changes to the `guac.yaml` file or the `GUAC_GQL_ADDR` and `GUAC_CONFIG_PATH` environment variables will only take effect after you stop and restart the visualizer. Make sure to restart the visualizer any time you make changes to them.

## Running the visualizer locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The output should look like:

```
$ yarn dev
yarn run v1.22.19
$ next dev
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Using webpack 5. Reason: Enabled by default https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5
```

You can then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to
see the graph visualization.

Using the GUAC visualizer will look something like this:
