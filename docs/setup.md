# Getting started with GUAC Visualizer

## About

The GUAC Visualizer is an experimental utility that can be used to interact with
the GUAC services. It acts as a way to visualize the software supply chain graph
as well as a means to explore the supply chain, and prototype policies.

Since the GUAC Visaulizer is still in an early experimental stage, it is likely
that there may be some unexpected behavior or usage problems. For a more robust
use of GUAC, we recommend using the [GraphQL interface directly](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/blob/main/demo/GraphQL.md).

#### NOTE: Since the visualizer is still in an early experimental stage, it is likely that there may be some unexpected behavior or usage problems. Due to ongoing changes, please ensure to use <a href="https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer/releases/tag/v0.1.1" alt="link to visualizer's v0.1.1 release"><span style="color: green;">guac-visualizer's v0.1.1 release</span></a> with <a href="https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.1.2"><span style="color: green;">guac's v0.1.2 release</span></a>, since the latest versions of each repo may not work together. The following directions below demonstrate how to do this for a seamless setup.

## Requirements

**Tools:**

- yarn
- docker

### Services

To use the GUAC visualizer, you need to have the main GUAC server running. For more information on how to do this, click
[here](https://docs.guac.sh/getting-started/).

## Getting started

1. If you haven't already, download the main GUAC version `v0.1.2` from [this link](https://github.com/guacsec/guac/releases/tag/v0.1.2).
   - Follow steps 2-5 in https://docs.guac.sh/setup to get it running.
2. Download the specific GUAC visualizer version `v0.1.1` from [this link](https://github.com/guacsec/guac-visualizer/releases/tag/v0.1.1) and extract it in the same path as your GUAC repo.

Change directories into the visualizer's repo:

```bash
cd path/to/guac-visualizer
```

All commands run throughout this guide should be in this working directory.

## Running the visualizer from source

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

The output should look like:

````
$ yarn install
yarn install v1.22.19

## Configuration

By default, the GUAC Visualizer assumes that the GraphQL server is running on http://localhost:8080/query. However, you can optionally configure the visualizer to connect to a different GraphQL endpoint or to read from a `guac.yaml` config file from your curent working directory.

## Running the visualizer locally:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The output should look like:

```
$ yarn dev
yarn run v1.22.19
$ next dev
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Using webpack 5. Reason: Enabled by default https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5
```

You can then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to
see the graph visualization.
